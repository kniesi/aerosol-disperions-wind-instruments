This document describes the structure of raw data. The data include the pixel coordinates of the cloud contours in each frame for each player, task and perspective.

Data content:
- 3 trumpet, 3 cross flute and 3 clarinet players
- 3 tasks Mh-, Mh+ and Ml-
- 2 camera perspectives K1 (side view) and K3 (top view)
- Example:
	trumpet_1_Mh-_K1.snake		# trumpet player 1, task Mh-, K1 perspective (side view)

Data format:
- Ascii data, space separated
- Header: Length of data file, i.e. total number of frames in the file.
- Data field: Number of point coordinates describing the cloud contour in the respective frame followed by the coordinates (x,y) of each point.
- Example:
	
	Length		# Header
	155			# Header

	24			# Number of points describing the cloud contour
	546	405		# x- and y- coordinate in pixels

Remarks for the data of the flutes:
For the flutes, the data of perspective K3 (top view) consist of two files ..._K3-1.snake and ..._K3-2.snake showing the two separated smoke clouds exiting at the mouth piece and at the end of the instrument. 
In the paper, the two separated clouds were merged for the distance analysis in y-direction shown in fig. 5b. 
For flute player 3 in task Mh-, only one file for K3 perspective is available as the smoke exiting at the mouth and the end of the instrument could not segmented separately.
